# EarBit
‘EarBit’ is an experimental wearable system that automatically monitors users’ eating activities. Within the system, the head-mounted proximity sensor collects data from a number of sensing modalities and send the data to a mobile application via Bluetooth. The mobile app then exchanges the raw data and outputs of a machine learning model with a server.
